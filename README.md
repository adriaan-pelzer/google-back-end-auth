googleBackendAuth
=================

Build an authenticated back end service that uses google auth tokens
--------------------------------------------------------------------

*It's easy as pie to authenticate users in the front end using [google sign-in for Javascript](https://developers.google.com/identity/sign-in/web/sign-in). Authenticate your back end or APIs by using the token you get from google, and authenticate requests from other back ends by signing the request with the google app token and secret*

##INSTALL

Firstly, in your repository, run:

```
    npm install --save google-backend-auth
```

Then, in your code:

```
    const googleBackendAuth = require ( 'google-back-end-auth' );
```

##FRONT END AUTH

To authenticate a front end request, the consumer simply needs to add the id_token they get from google to the query, like this

```
    http://your-api.com/some-resource?id_token=<the-id-token-from-google>
```

##BACK END AUTH

Back end authentication works by adding a signature to the query. This signature is calculated from a combination of google tokens and request parameters (url, method, and optionally, body). It is added like this:

```
    http://your-api.com/some-resource?sig=<signature>
```

The back end uses one of two methods (both supported by the same method in this module):

###Signing the request *with* full payload

```
    const signature = googleBackendAuth.sign ( google_client_id, google_client_secret, url, method, body );
```

###Signing the request *without* full payload

```
    const signature = googleBackendAuth.sign ( google_client_id, google_client_secret, url, method );
```

or, if you're using the node *request* module, you can use the *signRequest* helper function:

```
    const googleConfig = {
        client_id: '<your-google-client-id>',
        client_secret: '<your-google-client-secret>'
    };

    request ( googleBackendAuth.signRequest ( googleConfig, {
        url: 'http://your-api.com/some-resource'
    } ), callback );
```

##VERIFY THE TOKEN/SIGNATURE IN YOUR API

*This only works for back end auth _without_ full body payload*

```
    const googleConfig = {
        client_id: '<your-google-client-id>',
        client_secret: '<your-google-client-secret>',
        enforce: true,
        whitelist: [
            /.*\.your-domain.com/,   // Can match regular expressions
            'some@outlier-email.com' // Or singular email addresses, as strings
        ] // An empty whitelist will disable id_token based authentication
    };

    googleBackendAuth.verifyRequest ( googleConfig, req, ( error, token ) => {
        if ( error ) {
            // The error will always be a string, giving an indication why authentication failed
            // It will be one of the following:
            //     invalid token - the token wasn't generated by google
            //     expired - the user token is not recent enough
            //     not authentic - the token might have been tampered with
            //     wrong app id - the google client_id doesn't match the one that the user authenticated against
            //     not authorised - didn't match anything in the whitelist
            //     signature verification failed - back end server signature is not correct
            //     authentication required - no authentication parameters was sent, and googleConfig.enforce is set
        }

        console.log ( token.type ) // One of:
            // id_token - this will also have a userData attribute, with the user's details
            // sig - back end signature authentication
            // noAuth - only when googleConfig.enforce === false, and no authentication was used
    } );
```
